Tentative to build on top of e4ds-template a better error handling 
with some of the new Spring 3.2 features http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.2.x/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#new-in-3.2

It is a tentative to address open issue https://code.google.com/p/extdirectspring/issues/detail?id=23
Form post hands off to spring so any exceptions aren't handled correctly by the front-end.

Main additions are an ErrorController and an ErrorConfig to add some meat to default Spring handlers and make them compatible to Ext Direct 

by launching http://localhost:8080/error.html
some errors are handled.

Some more use cases are required to catch some tricky errors which occur beyond the scope of EDS router.

below the original project description
-----------------------------------------
Sample application with ExtJs4, ExtDirectSpring, Spring Framework 3.2, Spring Data JPA, Hibernate, Spring Security.
See the application in action: http://e4ds.rasc.ch

To start the application from the command line type
mvn tomcat7:run

Open a browser and go to 
http://localhost:8080


For easier development and debugging there is the class StartTomcat in the 
default package. Simply run this class like a normal java program inside
your development environment.
